The Koderunners Community was started on February, 2017 by a group of students passionate about coding and technology. The Machine Learning team was founded on November, 2018 as a branch of the existing Koderunners community to bring together machine learning developers and practitioners for constructive collaboration and development. We look towards the creation of a codebase of readable open source code which would be reusable by developers of Koderunners and the entire machine learning community at large. 

The team also collaborates with the other branches of Koderunners to innovate and find solutions to existing problems that pertain us.
