The Koderunners Community was started by a group of students passionate about coding and technology who had a vision of bringing other like-minded and passionate people together. Hence our journey began on February, 2017 through workshops on Creative Programming that inspired students to put their coding skills to create wonderful art.

KoderunnersML, the Machine Learning Developers' Pool was started on November, 2018 as a branch of the existing Koderunners community to bring together machine learning developers and practitioners for constructive collaboration and development. Here at KoderunnersML, we look towards the creation of educational materials and open source codebases which would effectively benifit the Machine Learning Community worldwide. We also collaborates with the other branches of Koderunners to innovate and find solutions to existing problems that pertain us.
